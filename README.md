**Copycord** is a Discord server cloner, designed to help you clone and synchronize an entire server in real time. By leveraging your user account‚Äôs WebSocket connection together with a dedicated bot, Copycord keeps your clone server fully up to date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Features:**
> - Clones host server categories and channels on first run
> - Detects channel renames, position changes, and recreates missing channels on the fly
> - Category and channel filtering
> - Creates webhooks in all channels used to forward identical messages as they are sent
> - The user account in the host server handles listening; a separate bot handles relaying, minimizing exposure
> - Send DM announcements in realtime to specific users when a message contains a designated keyword
> - Slash commands and community server features
> - Clone entire channel message history ‚ú®üÜï
> - Scrape the host server member list and output a file containing all member IDs ‚ú®üÜï
>


## How It Works

1. **Listen**  
   Establishes a WebSocket connection using your user token to capture host-server events.

2. **Sync**  
   Compares the live server structure against a local database, then creates, renames, moves, or deletes channels and categories as needed.

3. **Relay**  
   For each new message, sends it via webhook‚Äîpreserving content, author name, and avatar‚Äîin the clone server.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker¬†Compose  
- Two Discord applications/accounts: one for listening, one for relaying

### Setup

1. **Prepare the clone server**  
   Create a new Discord server to receive mirrored content.  

2. **Obtain your user token**  
   - Log into Discord in a browser with your account.
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Enable device emulation mode (Ctrl+Shift+M), then paste the code below into the console and press Enter:
      ```js
      const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
      console.log(
        "Token: %c%s",
        "font-size:16px;",
        JSON.parse(
          document.body.appendChild(iframe).contentWindow.localStorage.token
        )
      );
      iframe.remove();
      ```
   - Copy and store this token securely.

3. **Create and configure the bot**  
   - In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot.
   - Under **Installation**, set the Install Link to `None` and click save.
   - Under **Bot**, click reset token and store your bot token somewhere secure, disable `Public Bot`, and enable these intents:  
     - `Presence`  
     - `Server Members`  
     - `Message Content`  
   - Under **OAuth2**, generate an invite url with (Scopes: `bot`, Bot Permissions: `Administrator`) and invite the bot to your clone server.

## Configuration

### 1. Create a new /Copycord folder and add `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` 

In the new folder, create `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`: 

`Copycord/docker-compose.yml`
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand docker-compose.yml example</summary>

```yaml
services:
  server:
    container_name: copycord-server
    image: ghcr.io/copycord/copycord-server:v1.9.0
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  client:
    container_name: copycord-client
    image: ghcr.io/copycord/copycord-client:v1.9.0
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    depends_on:
      - server
    restart: unless-stopped
```
</details>

`Copycord/.env`
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand .env example</summary>
  
```yaml
# --- SERVER (BOT in the CLONE guild) ---
SERVER_TOKEN=            # your bot token
CLONE_GUILD_ID=          # destination guild ID (where cloning goes)
COMMAND_USERS=           # comma-separated user IDs allowed to run server commands

# --- WHAT TO DELETE WHEN REMOVED ON HOST (defaults: True) ---
DELETE_CHANNELS=True     # True: delete cloned channels; False: keep & drop mapping
DELETE_THREADS=True      # True: delete cloned threads;  False: keep & drop mapping
DELETE_ROLES=True        # True: delete cloned roles;    False: keep & drop mapping

# --- WHAT TO CLONE (toggle features) ---
CLONE_EMOJI=True         # clone emojis
CLONE_STICKER=True       # clone stickers
CLONE_ROLES=True         # clone roles

# --- ROLE PERMISSIONS ---
MIRROR_ROLE_PERMISSIONS=True   # True: also mirror role perms; False: only name/color/etc

# --- CLIENT (YOUR ACCOUNT watching the HOST guild) ---
CLIENT_TOKEN=            # your user token
HOST_GUILD_ID=           # source guild ID (what you‚Äôre mirroring)

# --- RUNTIME ---
ENABLE_CLONING=True      # master on/off for realtime cloning
LOG_LEVEL=INFO           # INFO or DEBUG
```
</details>

### 2. Create the /data folder and add config.yml inside

Create the /data folder in the main Copycord folder and the config file into /data: 

`Copycord/data/config.yml`

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand config.yml example</summary>

```yaml
# Copycord config.yml
#
# How it works
# ------------
# ‚Ä¢ WHITELIST (allow-list):
#     - If ANY IDs are listed, ONLY those categories/channels are cloned.
#     - Leave BOTH WHITELIST lists empty to disable whitelist mode.
#
# ‚Ä¢ EXCLUDED (deny-list):
#     - Drops whatever is listed.
#
# ‚Ä¢ Precedence (practical rules):
#     1) Channel whitelist > channel exclude
#     2) Channel exclude > category whitelist   <-- (lets you whitelist a category but drop a few channels)
#     3) Category whitelist > category exclude
#
# ‚Ä¢ IDs:
#     - Use IDs from the HOST guild (the source), not the clone guild.
#     - Right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúCopy ID‚Äù in Discord (Developer Mode).

whitelist:
  categories: []   # e.g. [123456789012345678, 234567890123456789]
  channels: []     # e.g. [345678901234567890]

excluded:
  categories: []   # e.g. [456789012345678901]
  channels: []     # e.g. [567890123456789012]
```
</details>

### 3. Launch Copycord

Make sure you have Docker¬†&¬†Docker¬†Compose installed, then open a command prompt in the same directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will pull the latest images, start both the **server** (bot) and **client** (listener), and mount `./data` for database and logs.
##
### Slash commands
- [Slash Commands Wiki](docs/slash_commands.md)
##

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copycord uses self‚Äëbot methods (listening via a user token), which violates Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service and may result in account termination. Although our two‚Äëstep design reduces exposure, **use at your own risk**. We strongly recommend using an alternate account for the listening component.
